This is the cannonical repository of Super Connect 5
Super connect 5 is a simple and fun connect 5 game on iOS
The goal is to make a fun, multiplayer experience. Both local and online.

It has a lot of interesting stuff and hopefully will have a lot of users.

It started with a prototype(now forgotten) and a cool weekend in mexico city.

Right now it has local play and simple multiplayer game.

I would like to refactor:
-> Move AI to a ComputerMove class
-> Refactor the logic to have a rule engine, and write things like try to "*XXXO" and that would search in all directions(in random order)
-> Move the networking code to a networking class

Things to do:
-> Add sign in the play screen
-> Test with more than 2 people
-> Make the Symbol and image be the same on all clients
  -> Piece has an id, form string, color string; Is it core data?g

-> Achievements
-> Make the cmputer random move make it closer to the game

Later:
-> Leaderboard
